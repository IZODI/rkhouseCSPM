**Spawns: Spawns are given a 15 minute timer since the timer is assumed to be unknown. (Your maps will likely have a spawnpoint option though) Command: .spawn <pokemon_name> Example: .spawn larvitar 34.101085 -118.287312 <br />

**Raids (currently no eggs): Command: .raid <gym_name> <pokemon_name> <raid_level> <minutes_remaining> Example: .raid "Silverlake Painted" Rayquaza 5 29 <br />

Gym names in raids do not have to be completely filled in, just enough so MySQL can find a single gym.
